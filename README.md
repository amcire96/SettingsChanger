# SettingsChanger

This app changes settings at certain times.

With this app, the user can change the device's volume, wifi, or bluetooth settings in the future.
This might be useful for situations when the user knows at a certain time that they want a certain setting changed.

For example, during class, the user might always want the device to be silent and perhaps have wifi/bluetooth disabled.
This app allows the user to add setting changes at a specified time during a specified day of the week in order to achieve this.
